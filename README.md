# Project Summary 

This project is my fourth and final milestone project (Full Stack Frameworks With Django) for the Code Institute Diploma in Software Development.

The purpose of the project is to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset , setting up an authentication mechanism and providing paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service.

## Site Purpose 

The purpose of the site is to sell furniture items on an online store called Kassie. Customers can purchase items and user engagement is encouraged through the ability to leave reviews and comments and to create user profiles.

The site is intended to be visually appealing, and easy to navigate. It has a responsive design so that it can be viewed easily on mobile and desktop.

# UX

## Goals

### Site Owner Goals

As a site owner I want to be able to:

- Create a visually appealing site with a strong brand identity.
- Add products on the website so I can add new items to my stores.
- Edit existing products in my store so I can change product prices, descriptions, images and other product information.
- Delete products on the website so I can remove items from my store.
- Have links that direct users to our social sites for further engagement.
- Keep track of sales data to inform future product choices.

### Site User Goals

The central target audience for Kassie are:

- People who would like to shop for furniture. 
- People who would like to own quality furniture. 
- People who would like the ease of shopping online for furniture.
- People who value door to door delivery.

As a site user I want to be able to:

- Find furniture needed for my home. 
- Enjoy browsing all the furniture products.
- Be able to navigate the shop easily, find what I need and make a safe and secure purchase.
- Buy from a trustworthy online shop. 

## User Stories

As a visitor to the Kassie website I expect/want/need:

1. To easily find what I am looking for, I want the layout of the site to make sense so I am not confused or put off using it. 

1. The ability to search through small amounts of information to find what I need, and then be able to easily click to get more detailed information when I need it.

1. The site to be easily navigable from any device, desktop, tablet or phone. For the content to look good and be useable on all of these devices.

1. To be able to add products to a wishlist that I wish to purchase at a later time. 

1. To be able to read reviews of products bought from previous customers, to build trust in my purchase.

1. Leave a review on a product so that I can inform other shoppers about whether it was a good purchase or not.

1. For all information and images to be laid out in a clear and easy to understand way, on whatever size screen I am viewing the website on.

1. To be able to easily find out all the information I need to make an informed purchase. I expect information about the description, ingredients, and instructions where necessary. 

1. A text search function so that I can quickly narrow down my search when looking for something specific

1. To be able to see a summary of my order during the checkout process.

1. That once I am logged in I can access my account details and update them if I need to. 

1. To be able to find information on my past orders. 

1. To be able to connect to the businesses social media channels, to keep up to date with new items and deals on the site. 

1. To be able to easily get in contact with the shop owner via a telephone number or email.

1. Feedback from the website I am using when I interact with it, I expect pop ups and modals to inform me when my forms have been completed and sent correctly. Or to let me know when an error has ocurred and what to do next.

## Design Choices

### Fonts

- The primary and only font 'Roboto' was chosen for the text of the site because of it clear readability and clean style. 

### Colors
- The colour scheme for this site was rendered on [Cooler](https://coolors.co/) and can be seen below:

<div align="center">
    <img src="/media/readme/color-palette.png" alt="Colors used in the Kassie website" aria-label="Colors used in the Kassie website"/>
</div>

- Black: #000000
- Eerie Black: #222222
- Ming: #036A78
- Cultured: #F6F6F6
- White: #FFFFFF

- The Ming blue was chosen as the brand color for Kassie, as it provides a strong presence and is a fun color. 

- The blacks were chosen for most text and buttons, as it is neutral and compliments the greys. 

- The greys were chosen for this project to provide a neutral background color to information, making a clear seperation from the white background. 

### Styling

- Sharp corner styling was chosen for its bold feel, and as it is a common stylistic choice of bootstrap it blends well with styles used from that library on this project.

## Wireframes

These wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) during the Scope Plane part of the design and planning process for this project.

# Deployment

## How to run this project locally

To run this project on your own IDE follow the instructions below:

Ensure you have the following tools: 
    - An IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

The following **must be installed** on your machine:
    - [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
    - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - [Git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)

To allow you to access all functionality on the site locally, ensure you have created free accounts with the following services:
    - [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
    - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [set up an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)

Please click the links above for documentation on how to set these up and retrieve the necessary environment variables.

### Instructions
1. Save a copy of the github repository located at https://github.com/PillowFishSticks/Kassie-MS4 by clicking the "download zip" button at the top of the page and extracting the zip file to your chosen folder. If you have Git installed on your system, you can clone the repository with the following command.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/PillowFishSticks/Kassie-MS4
    ```

2. Open your preferred IDE, open a terminal session in the unzip folder or cd to the correct location.

3. A virtual environment is recommended for the Python interpreter, I recommend using Pythons built in virtual environment. Enter the command:
    ```
    python -m .venv venv
    ```  
_NOTE: The `python` part of this command and the ones in other steps below assumes  you are working with a windows operating system. Your Python command may differ, such as `python3` or `py`_

4. Activate the .venv with the command:
    ```
    .venv\Scripts\activate 
    ```
_Again this **command may differ depending on your operating system**, please check the [Python Documentation on virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for further instructions._

5. If needed, Upgrade pip locally with
    ```
    pip install --upgrade pip.
    ```

6. Install all required modules with the command 
    ```
    pip -r requirements.txt.
    ```

7. Set up the following environment variables within your IDE. 

    - If using VSCode, locate the `settings.json` file within the .vscode directory and add your environment variables as below. Do not forget to restart your machine to activate your environment variables or your code will not be able to see them: 

    ```json
    "terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
        "HOSTNAME": "<enter hostname here>",
        "DEV": "1",
        "SECRET_KEY": "<your secret key>",
        "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY ": "<insert stripe public key>",
        "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY": "<insert stripe secret key>",
        "STRIPE_WH_SECRET": "<insert stripe webhook secret>",
        "EMAIL_HOST_PASS": "<insert the gmail password>",
        "EMAIL_HOST_USER": "<insert your email address>",
        "STRIPE_WH_SECRET": "<enter key here>",
        "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "<enter key here>",
        "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "<enter bucket name here>",
        "USE_AWS": "True",
    }
    ```

    - If using an IDE that includes a `bashrc` file, open this file and enter all the environment variables listed above using the following format: 
    ```
    HOSTNAME="<enter key here>"
    ```
    - `HOSTNAME` should be the local address for the site when running within your own IDE.
    - `DEV` environment variable is set only within the development environment, it does not exist in the deployed version, making it possible to have different settings for the two environments. For example setting DEBUG to True only when working in development and not on the deployed site.

8. If you have restarted your machine to activate your environment variables, do not forget to reactivate your virtual environment with the command used at step 4.

9. Migrate the admin panel models to create your database template with the terminal command
    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

10. Create your superuser to access the django admin panel and database with the following command, and then follow the steps to add your admin username and password:
    ```
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

11. You can now run the program locally with the following command: 
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

12. Once the program is running, go to the local link provided and add `/admin` to the end of the ur. Here log in with your superuser account and create instances of ShippingDestination and Product within the new database.

13. Once instances of these items exist in your database your local site will run as expected.

## Heroku Deployment

To deploy Kassie to heroku, take the following steps:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file using the terminal command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

2. Create a `Procfile` with the terminal command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`.

3. `git add` and `git commit` the new requirements and Procfile and then `git push` the project to GitHub.

3. Create a new app on the [Heroku website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard. Give it a name and set the region to whichever is applicable for your location.

4. From the heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select GitHub.

5. Confirm the linking of the heroku app to the correct GitHub repository.

6. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".

7. Set the following config vars:

| Key | Value |
--- | ---
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<insert from the aws csv>`
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<insert from the aws csv>`
DATABASE_URL | `<your postgres database url>`
EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<insert the gmail password>`
EMAIL_HOST_USER | `	<insert your email address>`
SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | `<insert stripe public key >`
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | `<insert stripe secret key >`
STRIPE_WH_SECRET | `<insert stripe webhook secret>`
USE_AWS | `True`

8. From the command line of your local IDE:
    - Enter the heroku postres shell 
    - Migrate the database models 
    - Create your superuser account in your new database
    
     Instructions on how to do these steps can be found in the [heroku devcenter documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql).

9. In your heroku dashboard, click "Deploy". Scroll down to "Manual Deploy", select the master branch then click "Deploy Branch".

10. Once the build is complete, click the "View app" button provided.

11. From the link provided add `/admin` to the end of the url, log in with your superuser account and create instances of ShippingDestination and Product within the new database.

12. Once instances of these items exist in your database your heroku site will run as expected.

    - [joybird](https://joybird.com/)
    - [Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/)

- The README file was taken from both Anna Greave's 'The House of Mouse' project and MAN95-dev's 'PetPals' project to use as a template.
